# Page Structure, Top Memu:
Top menu on every(?) page.  The menu shows sub-pages when the user clicks on (hovers over?) the parent page in the menu.

* Page: Home
    * The landing page for `/`
    * Short description of the company and what we do.
    * Show off top products or three
* Page: Products
    * List product categories: Ham Radio and Audiophile
    * Page: Ham Radio
        * Landing page to describe what and why
        * Link to Woo-managed Product category page
        * Alternatively, can we add the descriptive text to the Woo-managed category page?
        * Page: SOAR (Not at launch)
            * Probably not to start, but some day when I have multiple products in the SOAR category (which is planned), having a single page that talks about the whole product line and how it all fits together will be good.
        * Page: SmartShack (Not at launch)
            * There will likely be other product sub-categories that will also justify their own page like this.
    * Page: Audiophile
        * Landing page to describe what and why
            * At launch, this will be a big fat "Coming soon! Ish! Soon-ish! Not real soon, but some day!"
        * Link to Woo-managed Product category page
        * Alternatively, can we add the descriptive text to the Woo-managed category page?
* Page: Media
    * Page: About Halibut Electronics
        * Static page with the story of Halibut Electronics, where the name came from, how I got into this mess, etc.
    * Page: Blog
        * Not sure if I'll use it often, but it'll be there.
        * Include link to the RSS feed.
    * Page: Videos
        * Maybe this should just be part of the blog?  Is it possible to add YouTube videos to a WordPress RSS feed?
        * Links to YouTube videos.
* Page: Support/Contact Us
    * Explain that this is a one-person shop, so support is best effort.
    * Links to groups.io, Twitter, Mastodon, and possibly Discord/Matrix if I ever set those up.
    * Email for sales and support.
        * Email form on the web page? I've never been a huge fan of these, but I don't know how customers feel about them.
        * It's not my intention to build a full-on CRM, at least not yet.
* Cart:
    * Managed by Woo.

# Footer
* Can we do cycling quotes?  Every time a page is loaded, a randomly selected quote is shown?
* There's a bunch of standard stuff I see at the bottom of most corporate pages: links to About Us, Contact Us, etc.

# Right side widget bar
I'm not sure I want this, but if we do:
* Embed my latest tweet, toot (Mastodon), and/or YouTube video?
* Summary of what's in the cart?

# Product Pages
Managed by WooCommerce.

Tabs on every product page with at least the following:
* Description (Fluffy words)
* Technical Details (Hard facts)
* Documentation/Downloads (Instructions, Firmware updates, etc)
